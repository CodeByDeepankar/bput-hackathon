## 🎮 How It Works

### **User Flow:**

1. **Student Takes Quiz**
   - Selects topic (e.g., "Data Structures")
   - Answers questions
   - Submits final answer

2. **Quiz Completion**
   - System calculates score percentage
   - Redirects to `/student/quiz/results?score=55&topic=Data%20Structures&total=10&correct=5`

3. **Results Page Logic**
   ```javascript
   if (score < 60%) {
     // Check if game exists for this topic
     if (gameRecommendationMap[topic]) {
       // Show recommendation card
       // Start 3-second countdown
       // Redirect to game with reason parameter
     } else {
       // Show generic study recommendation
     }
   } else {
     // Show congratulations message
   }
   ```

4. **Game Page**
   - Checks URL for `reason` and `from=quiz` parameters
   - Shows personalized banner if present
   - User can dismiss banner or start playing immediately
