# GYANARATNA Platform - Full-Stack Guide

## System Architecture

This is a comprehensive learning management system built with modern technologies:

### Backend Stack
- **Next.js API Route Handlers (Node.js)** - REST API served from `frontend/src/app/api`
- **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** - Managed relational database
- **@supabase/supabase-js** - Supabase client for server-side access

### Frontend Stack  
- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Clerk** - Authentication and user management
- **Custom API client** - Communicates with the Supabase-backed REST API

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The legacy `backend/server.js` Express server has been fully migrated into Next.js API route handlers under `frontend/src/app/api`. All endpoints referenced below map to files within that directory structure.

git clone <repository-url>
cd gamified-stem-learning

# Setup backend
cd backend
npm install

# Create .env file
cat > .env << EOF
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co

```

### 2. Configure Supabase

1. Sign in to Supabase and create a project
2. Navigate to **Project Settings ‚Üí API** to copy the Project URL and Service Role key
3. Use the SQL editor to create tables matching the schema documented above
4. (Optional) Load seed data using Supabase's SQL editor or CSV import

### 3. Setup Frontend

```bash
# Setup frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install

# Create .env.local file
cat > .env.local << EOF
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key

# Frontend will run on http://localhost:3000
```

### 4. Verify Connectivity

- Hit `http://localhost:4000/health` to confirm the backend can reach Supabase
- Use the Supabase dashboard to confirm new rows appear when creating subjects/quizzes

## Usage Guide

### For Teachers

1. **Sign up** with teacher role at `/role-select`
2. **Create subjects** in teacher dashboard
3. **Add quizzes** with multiple-choice questions
4. **Monitor student progress** through analytics

### For Students

1. **Sign up** with student role at `/role-select`
2. **Browse subjects** on student dashboard
3. **Take quizzes** with real-time timer
4. **Track daily streaks** and maintain learning momentum
5. **View progress** and achievements

### Real-time Streak System

The streak system automatically:
- ‚úÖ Tracks daily quiz completions
- üî• Maintains streak counters
- üìä Provides daily activity summaries
